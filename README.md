`ETF ANALYZER` -- **Passive investing** *means that you invest in a basket of assets thatâ€™s called an exchange-traded fund (ETF*)*. *This way, you donâ€™t spend time researching individual stocks or companies or take the risk of investing in a single stock. ETFs offer more diversification*
*In this Challenge assignment, youâ€™ll build a financial database and web application by using SQL, Python, and the VoilÃ  library to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF*.
